            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Let this then be the firſt means of doing our actions wel, to do them purely for the loue of God; wherby we ſhall arriue to do them perfectly, and with our vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indeauour (as doing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for God Almighty) although neither our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour nor any one els do looke on &amp;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12334:14"/>
take account of our performance of them. Our <hi>B. F. Ignatius</hi> asked a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne brother once, who was a little negligent in his office, wherefore he did thoſe things? the brother anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the loue of God: whereupon our B. Father told him, that if he did his things ſo negligently againe, he would giue him a good pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for his payns. For ſaid he, if you did them for any men, the fault would not be ſo great to performe them with ſo much neglect and carleſnes; but to do them in ſuch a manner, for ſo great a maſter, is a negligence not to be borne with all.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond means, which the Holy Saints do commend vnto vs, &amp; which indeed is the moſt effications of al is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to walke in the preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God Almighty. <hi>Seneca</hi> although Heathen was wont to ſay that a man who was deſirous to becom vertuous, and to do all his Actions well &amp; lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably, could arriue vnto it by no ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyer way, then to imagin himſelfe when he did or ſayd any thing, in the preſence of ſome graue honourable

how much it conferres, vnto the well performing of our ordinary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which is of ſuch conſequence, that (as we ſhall in its place declare) we are not only to inſiſt vpon that verity, that we are in the preſence of God, but we are to ſerue our ſelues of it to do our workes the better and perfecter; in ſuch ſort notwithſtanding, as ſhould we reflecting on the preſence of God, remayne doing our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s imperfectly and negligently, it would not be a good deuotion, but rather an illuſion and deceyt. And ſome ad yet further &amp; ſay that that preſence of God Almighty which we ſhould procure to haue, and which the holy Scripture and Bleſſed Saints ſo much recommend vnto vs, is this well and perfect performance of our works, in ſuch manner, as they may wortihly appeare before the face of God, and haue nothing in them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe his holy eyes: in briefe that they may be ſuch as may become vs to do in the preſence of ſo high a Maieſty.

firſt feruour, do euer get vp againe &amp; recouer that degree, from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they fel; but that rather they are ſtill falling from worſe to worſe: which is that (ſayth S. <hi>Bernard</hi>) which the Prophet <hi>Hieremy</hi> deplores,<note place="margin">Bern. ſer. <hi>3.</hi> infesto Apo.

                        <hi>How is the gold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured? How is that beſt of colours changed?</hi> How is this prime beauty decayd, and withered?

                     <p>And therefore commonly ſpeaking, there is but little hope of thoſe, who begin to decay and looſe ſpirit in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is a thing we ought to haue a liuely feeling, and a great hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of: and the reaſon of it is that, which we haue toucht vpon before, becauſe they grow worſewith freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vſe of the remedies, and become more ſicke when thoſe medicines are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto them, which ordinarily bring health to other folkes; &amp; what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:12334:36"/>
can there be found out for ſuch as theſe? They hold with good reaſon his health for deſperate, who growes not better, but rather worſe, with the medicines which ſhould cure him: and this is the reaſon which makes vs haue ſuch an apprehenſion and horrour of the fall of a Religious man, whereas we are not much moued, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring of ſeculars. When a Phyſitian ſees a ſicke man very faint and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, or finds him by his pulſe broght low and weake, it ſeemes no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing vnto him; but when he obſerues the ſame ſymptomes, or ill diſpoſitions in a man that is ſtrong and luſty, he holdes it for a very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſigne, ſince ſuch an effect cannot proceed from any thing els, then from ſome peccant humour predominating in the body, which is the forerunner of ſome great ſickneſſe, or ineuitable death. And ſo is it in this, for if a ſecular man chaunce to fall into any ſinne, it is no new thing, nor ſtrange for one who paſſeth his life in ſo great negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, confeſſing but once a yeare, &amp; liuing among ſuch frequent occaſions of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:12334:37"/>
falling into ſinne: but if a Religious man, who is ſuſtayned with ſo much frequency of Sacramentes, ſo many prayers, and ſuch a number of holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, if he I ſay come once to fall, it is a ſigne of a decayed vertue, of a long rooted weaknes, and of approaching ruine, and therefore with good reaſon is it to be feared ſo much.</p>

                     <head>How much it imports Nouices to bestow the tyme of their Nouiciat well, and to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome themſelues then to do their Actions well. <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi>

                     <p>VVE may gather from that which hath been ſayd, how much it importes Nouices to make good vſe of their tyme of Nouiciate, &amp; to accuſtome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from that their beginning to do al the exerciſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion exactly, and with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. The firſt rule of the Maſter of the Nouices in the Society declars this cleerely vnto vs, &amp; in a briefe manner; which is not directed only vnto vs, but alſo to all other Religious perſons in general.<note place="margin">Re. <hi>1.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtra No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitiorum.</note> 
                        <hi>He shall vnderſtand</hi> (ſays the Rule) <hi>that there is a thing of great moment comitted vnto him.</hi> For the prouing of which, two weighty reaſons are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to make the Maſter of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices more vigilant ouer his charge, and more ſenſible of the importance of the thing committed to his care; the firſt is; <hi>becauſe on the firſt institution of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:12334:38"/>
Nouices, for the moſt part dependes their</hi> (enſuing) <hi>profit;</hi> &amp; the other, <hi>Becauſe the hope of the Society in our Lord doth likewiſe conſist therein.</hi> And to declare theſe two reaſons more in particular, I ſay firſt of all, that on this firſt education and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of vertue, which the Nouices firſt put on, depends morally ſpeaking all their aduancement or detriment in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, all their feruour or remiſneſſe, as we haue ſaid in the precedent chapter. For of one who paſſeth ouer his Noui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat tepidly &amp; with neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, there is ſcarcely any reaſon we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue to hope that he will become more feruent or obſeruant hereafter, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary there are many preſumptions &amp; pregnant reaſons to doubt the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>But to explicat more clearly this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, let vs enter into more particular diſcourſe with the Nouice and well weighing the reaſons, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uince him by force of them. Now whileſt you are in your Nouiciat you haue as much time and leaſure, as you can deſire, to attend vnto your interiour &amp; your progreſſe in ſpirit: vnto which end you haue all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:12334:39"/>
requiſit helps &amp; comodities, ſince your Superiours imploy you in nothing els beſides, neyther require of you any other thing: this is their end and ought likewiſe to be yours. You haue for the preſent the frequent examples of your fellow Nouices, who aſpire vnto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to perfection; which is a motiue which ought much to animate you, &amp; to ſtire you vp, when you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with no others but ſuch as thoſe: neither do I ſee how you can remaine negligent and remiſſe among ſo many who make ſuch great profit in vertue. You are now free from al ſolicitude &amp; cares, and haue your hart freely left to the purſuit of vertue: there is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment which may diuert you from it, and the examples of many do inuite you to it. If therfore now, when you haue nothing els to attend vnto, and euery thing to further you, you make no profit, nor prouide you of no ſtocke of vertue for the future; what will become of you, when your hart ſhall be deuided, and you imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a thouſand buſineſſes? If at this preſent with ſo many aydes, ſo preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:12334:39"/>
and forcible, you make not your Prayer well, you do not your duty in your Examens, you are negligent in your Additions, and haue no care to performe your other ſpirituall exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes well; how will you do, when you ſhall haue your ſtudies to exact your attention; and when afterwardes you come to be imployed in hearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, teaching, preaching and the like? If now with ſo many conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſpiritual exhortations, with ſo many examples, ſolicitations, &amp; euen, in a ſweet ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, addition of viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, you make no ſpiritual profit; what wil you doe when you ſhall be as it were beſieged round with occaſions of lets and hinderances, to diuert you from it? If now in the beginning of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, when euen the nouelty of the thinges were ſufficient to ſtirre you vp to feruour and deuotion to them, you go forwards with ſo much languor &amp; tepidity; what will become of you, when your eares ſhall be frequently accuſtomed to heare thoſe thinges, which may diuert &amp; carry you away? And what is yet more, if for the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12334:40"/>
when your paſſions doe but begin yet to ſprout forth, and your inclinations are but (as it were) in their infancy, &amp; wanting force, you haue not force, nor reſolution to reſiſt them, for feare of labour and difficulty; how will you make head againſt them and ouercome them hereafter, when they ſhall haue taken deep root, and be growne ſo ſtrong, and naturall to you by length of tyme and cuſtome, as the departing from them would be a diuorce vnto you, not much leſſe violent then that of your ſoule and body?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Dorotheus</hi> declares this by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample borrowed of one of thoſe ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers,<note place="margin">Doroth. doctr. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> who ſitting once with his diſciples in a groue of Cypres trees, where ſome were great, others grafts and others of middle grouth, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded one of his Diſciples to plucke one of them vp by the roots, which he did preſently, it being but a graft; afterwards he pointed vnto one which was of a bigger ſort, and bid him likewiſe plucke vp that which he did, though not without much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence &amp; applying both his hands vnto
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:12334:40"/>
it; then he ſet him vnto another which was yet greater, which he could not plucke vp, without an others helpe; &amp; laſtly appointing one of the beſt rooted of them to be plucked vp, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious together could not once ſtirr it from the place: where vpon the graue Father toke occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſcourſe in this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner vnto them. Behould (ſayd he) it is iuſt ſo with the paſſions of our mind: it is eaſy for vs in the begining when they haue not yet taken root, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them with the leaſt diligence, but after you haue ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take root a while, they will gather ſo much ſtrength from your indulgence to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it will coſt you payne inough and require a ſtrong reſolution for to root them out; if notwithſtanding you can effect it with all your induſtry.</p>
                     <p>From hence may we ſee the greatnes of that tentation and deceit by which we are wonne to differ our amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſpirituall profit from day to day, and to make account afterwards to mortify and ouercome our ſelues, which for the preſent we dare not take in hand, becauſe of the difficulty and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:12334:41"/>
tediouſnes thereof. If you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the difficulty when it is not much; how will you be able to reſiſt it when this grown ſtrong &amp; mighty? if now when your paſſions are (as it were but whelpes) you trembled for feare of them; how will you dare to with ſtand them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall grow to be Lyons in ſtrength and fury? ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſure your ſelfe, that if you doe your actions now with ſo much cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, negligence &amp; imperfection, you will be far more tepid and negligent hereafter. If now you are no good No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, hereafter you will be no good Religious man, nor Operarius: if now you are negligent in obſeruing your rules, you will be much more negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearafter. Laſtly if now you haue but little care to do your exerciſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutly, and with perfection, all that you ſhal doe hereafter wil be nothing worth.

The holy Ghoſt by the Prophet Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy admoniſheth vs of this, where he ſays, <hi>it is good for a man,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From this firſt reaſon proceeds the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:12334:42"/>
ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſeeing if the progreſſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious conſiſts in their firſt beginings and education, the good of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth likewiſe depend theron. For it is not the walles of the cloyſter, or col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which makes the Religion: but the perſons who are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregated in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and thoſe who are now in the Nouici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, are they who are afterwards to be the body of the Religion, and for this reaſon the Society thinkes it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to erect Seminaries &amp; Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges where youth ſhould be educated in vertue and learning together, but it alſo deſignes peculiar houſes for vertue only, where the Nouices attend vnto nothing els then to the abnegation and mortification of themſelues, and to the exerciſe of true and ſolid vertue as a foundation of far more importance &amp; neceſſity, then that of any learning or liberall ſcience. Vnto this end the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiciats are erected,<note place="margin">Pater Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. in ep. ad Societ.</note> which are (as <hi>B. F. Borgia</hi> ſays) like Bethleems for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, which is interpreted <hi>the houſe of bread,</hi> here they prouide them of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit &amp; prouiſion for ſo long a voyage, and ſo many daungers which do threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:12334:42"/>
them. This is our harueſt, and our fruitfull ſeaſon; this thoſe plentifull yeares, during the which we muſt lay vp ſtore, with <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for thoſe yeares of famine and ſterility to come. If the Inhabitants of Aegypt, could but haue appehended the neceſſity, of making beſt vſe of that ſame plentious time, they would not haue ſo lightly exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their granaries, of that prouiſion,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 41 48.</note> which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did ſo carefully buy vp. If you could but imagin how much it imports you to go out of the Nouiciat well furniſhed &amp; ſtored with ſpirituall prouiſion without doubt you would be farre from being ioyfull when you were to go fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, but rather you would be ſad and much afflicted, at the neceſſity of ſending you away, when you conſidered what ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of vertue and mortification you went away with al. And ſo <hi>B. F. Borgia</hi> was wont to ſay, that thoſe who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or were glade to haue made an end of their Nouiciat, did well ſhew that they had little vnderſtanding of ſpiritual things, and did not know the neceſſity which they had, conſidering
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:12334:43"/>
the daunger &amp; difficulty of their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to go out well furniſhed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion for it: of how rich, and well prouided of all vertue did our B.

Let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> procure to depart from the Nouiciat with an anſwerable feruour to this expectation of vs; let vs make due vſe of that ſo pretious time, ſeeing ſo long as we liue, we ſhall neuer haue the like time againe to make our profit of, and to gayne &amp; ſtore our ſelues with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual treaſure; let vs be wonderful wary of miſpending it, and letting the leaſt moment of it be loſt,<note place="margin">

                     <p>One of the greateſt graces &amp; fauours which our Sauiour doth to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he cals in their youth vnto Religion, &amp; for which they are to render him infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit thankes, is; that it is very eaſy for them then to apply themſelues to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; Religious diſcipline.

                     <p>The reaſon why thoſe ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not exhort their Nouices to take heed of this vice of vaine Glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, becauſe they knew there was no great feare of vaine glory in thoſe, who hauing newly left the world, had yet the woundes of their ſinnes open and freſhly bleeding, from whence they ſhould find matter inough of humility and ſhame, and therefore it was more need for them to be exerciſed in abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, pennance, and mortifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but thoſe more ancient in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who had already waſhed away
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:12334:57"/>
their ſinnes with their repentant teares who had vndergone hard penance, &amp; were wel entred on the way of vertue, had need of theſe admonitions, for the other who were yet full of paſſions, empty of ſollid vertue, who had not yet made an end of weeping for their ſinnes, and the forgetfulnes of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty into which they were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plunged, had no cauſe at all, to grow vayn-glorious, but much, to giue way vnto their ſhame and their iuſt cauſe of griefe.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore they ought to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confounded, who hauing diuers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues for to humble themſelues paſſe them blindly ouer, and become proud by looking only vpon ſomething more then ordinary, which they ſeeme vnto themſelues to haue done.

The ſecond ſort of corrupting and falſifying the word of God is that which makes more immediatly to our purpoſe.

Behould heere the patterne after which we ought to frame our ſelues, and which may make vs hartely aſhamed, to let our ſelues be carryed ſo away with the breath of vayne glory, for euery ſlight &amp; paltry thing we do.

God grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that but too too many of vs may not ſay with truth, what this good holy man ſaid out of humility.

be gathered how pure our intention ought to be, how free and deſingaged our ſelues, and how ſincerely we are to ſeeke God in all occaſions. And it is the Doctrine of the Holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church, <hi>S. Hierome, S. Gregory,</hi> &amp; <hi>S.

                        <hi>Do not reioice therefore, but becauſe your names are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred</hi> in heauen, our ioy ought not to depend vpon the euent of things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it might be as happy as that of theirs, but we are only to haue care to do thoſe workes, by the which we may merit to haue our names enroled in heauen. Let vs looke that we in our

For ſhould you reape ſuch aboundant fruit, by your ſermons, writinges, and conuerſation as to conuert a world, &amp; in the meane tyme ſhould neglect your ſelfe, all which you had done, would nothing profit you, according as our Sauiour ſayes in the Ghoſpell, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,<note place="margin">

The glorious Apoſtle S. <hi>Iames</hi> had certainly had but a poore reward, if the recompence of his labour had depended on the euent, and if he had beene to haue placed his contentment and felicity therein, who

When the Lord came to take an account of the Talents which he had diſtributed among his ſeruants, the ſacred Scripture ſays, that he came who had receaued fiue, &amp; ſayd: Lord you gaue me fiue talents, and here I haue gained other fiue vnto them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome his Lord ſayd: <hi>It is well done thou good and faythful ſeruant,</hi>

What is the reaſon of this, ſayth this holy Doctour? It is moſt iuſt, ſayth he; for the ones negligence, or the others diligence was not it, which made the ones gaine greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others, but the quantity of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents committed to their charge; for in

This is a point of great profit and ſingular conſolation, ſeeing it may be applyed to all offices &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; for if one be as carefull &amp; diligent to performe thoſe offices, which he hath in charge, as another is in the diſcharge of his, he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt merit as much as he, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his worke be nothing neere ſo much. For example, if I take as much paines as you for to prepare my ſelfe to preach, although I ſhould preach with neuer ſo ill a grace, whereas you one the contrary ſhould carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your audience with excellent ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, choice matter, good deliuery, it may happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuertheles, that I may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much, if not more then you. It is the like in matter of ſtudy, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one be but a ſimple ſcholler, &amp; you on the contrary haue an excellent wit, he knowes but little, and you are deeply learned, notwithſtanding he may merit more with that little which he hath, then you with all your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and your learning.

                        </note> had begun this leaſt Society of Ieſus, and had heard relation of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, ſayd it was that very thing, which for ſo many yeares togeather, he had beene labouring to effect with ſo much ſolicitude, and could neuer bring to paſſe, adding that it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to him, as to a little child, who being at the foot of ſome great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, deſirous to rowle ſome heauy burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp vnto the top, finds it aboue its forces to effect; when a ſtrong and mighty Gyant comming, takes vp that burthen which the child could not lift, and with eaſe carryes it there where the child deſires to haue it.

by this compariſon, himſelfe the child, and eſteeming <hi>S. Ignatius</hi> a Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant vnto him.

                        <hi>who</hi> as S. Paul ſayes) <hi>ſeeke not after any thing of their owne, but that which is of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> A true ſeruant of God Almighty ought in ſuch manner, to deſire the glory of God, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and profit of others ſoules, as when God is pleaſed to ſerue himſelfe therein, by meanes of any other, he is to be as glad and well content, as if God had vſed him for his inſtrument. And therefore it were a good manner of proceeding which we find practiſed by diuers great ſeruants or God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who when they perceaue themſelues vrged ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly on with the deſire and zeale of gayning ſoules, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly begge it of God by ſaying: O Lord

that ſuch or ſuch a ſoule might but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce come to know you, that ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be acquired to you, that his fruit may be done, that profit, this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned, and all this by ſuch meanes as you ſhall pleaſe, for me I pretend not to any part of it. Such as theſe wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke rightly, and in great purity, &amp; like vnto theſe are we ſincerely to carry our ſelues in the ſeruice of God, as not to ſeeke any proper honour &amp; eſteeme but only the greater honour and glory of God.</p>
                     <p>We may ſay the like alſo, as well in that which concernes our owne ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall progreſſe, of our brethren, for he who is diſcomfited when he ſees his brother make progreſſe in vertu, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt himſelf remaines behind doth not ſeeke purly the greater glory of God; for although it be true that a good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, ought to haue a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment and feeling, for that he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues not God ſo perfectly as he ought, neuertheles it followes not that he ſhould therefore be troubled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted, when he ſees another perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter then he, but on the contrary he is
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:12334:86"/>
to be glad of it, and to giue this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to his grieued ſoule, for ſeruing God Almighty with ſo great neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that how euer he through his ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes be wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting in his duty, yet there do not want thoſe who do ſupply in effect, yeelding in giuing prayſe &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto God, what he in wiſhes only propoſeth to himſelf. That ſadnes &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pining which ſome are troubled with, proceedeth from no other cauſe, then from a certaine enuy and ſecret pride: for ſhould one but deſire truly and in good earneſt the greater glory of God, it is moſt certaine, he ſhould haue a great ioy and contentment to ſee that others did increaſe in vertue and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, howſoeur on the other ſide he were ſorry &amp; aſhamed for not ſeruing God ſo feruently himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſigne is, when a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man doth his office and thoſe thinges which are commaunded him, in ſuch manner, as not to care more whether he be imployed in this, or that, whether he haue that office, or els be put to this, and is in one, and to the other content alike; for it is a moſt

euident ſigne, that we do our thinges only for the loue of God, and therefore doe we carry our ſelues with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of mind and indifference vnto all, ſeeking nothing but to fullfill the will of God in euery thing, and neuer troubling our ſelues with the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the thing we do: wheras if we do not vndertake thoſe offices which are humble &amp; laborious with as good a will, as the eaſy and honourable, it is a ſigne that we doe not performe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purely for God Almighty, but that we ſeeke our ſelues, our guſt and proper commodities in them.

                     <p>Thirdly it is a ſigne that we do not thinges purely for loue of God, but out of humane reſpects, when we deſire to approue vnto our ſuperiour all we do, and that he ſhould take notice of our paynes, and publiquely commend vs, or at leaſt by ſome exteriour ſignes expreſſe himſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
